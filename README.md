TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
    Execute the script test_food_db.py to see the corresponding results. The library is constructed in _food_db.py. 

SERVER INSTRUCTIONS:   
To run the server, make sure to have (at least) Python3 Installed
Python3 download link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/

After installing Python3, make sure you have pip, which allows you
to install Python libraries and packages easily

pip download link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

After pip has been installed, navigate to the folder where you have stored
the forked repo, and run pip install requirements.txt.

After this is done, run python3 main.py, and the server will start up.  If, for
some reason these programs do not work, open the project in PyCharm,
configure your python interpreter (if you have not already done so), and run the
program by clicking the green arrow button in the top right of the screen.374
